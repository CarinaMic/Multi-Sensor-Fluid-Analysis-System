# Multi-Sensor-Fluid-Analysis-System

## Overview

This repository contains the LabVIEW 2020 code for a analysis system of a fluid flow with 4 cameras (web cams), a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor. 

## Components

Key components of this integrated system include:

- **PC with Control Software and User Interface (Labview)**
- **Controller NI myRIO**
- **Pressure Sensor AMSYS AMS 5812-0050-D**
- **4x Logitech StreamCam**
- **Sample Chamber**

## System Description

The innovative test setup is used, among other things, as a control unit for the assessment of the stability of the gastrointestinal anastomosis.

## Getting Started

1. Install LabVIEW 2020.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the main project file (.lvproj) and open it.
4. Connect the controller (NI myRIO) including the sensors (temperature, pressure).
5. Connect all cameras (USB).
6. Start the project file.
